# Development Guidelines

## Thread Safety
- All shared data structures must be properly synchronized
- Use mutexes for critical sections
- Avoid race conditions in drone and server components

## Memory Management
- Fix memory leaks in `destroy()` function
- Replace `sprintf` with `snprintf` to prevent buffer overflows
- Consider implementing a free list for node reuse and reduced allocation overhead

## Socket Programming
- Use TCP for reliable communication
- Handle connection errors gracefully
- Implement timeouts for unresponsive clients
- Follow JSON message format as specified in [communication-protocol.md](mdc:communication-protocol.md)

## Testing
- Implement load testing with multiple drones
- Verify thread safety with concurrent operations
- Test fault tolerance by simulating disconnected drones
