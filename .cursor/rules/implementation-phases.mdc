# Implementation Phases

The project is implemented in three phases:

## Phase 1: Thread-Safe Lists & Simulated Clients/Servers
- Implement synchronization for thread-safe list operations
- Simulate drones and survivors with threads (no sockets yet)
- Visualize with SDL: survivors as red cells, idle drones as blue dots, missions as green lines

## Phase 2: Basic Socket Communication
- Replace simulated threads with real socket-based clients and servers
- Server implementation with multi-threaded handling of drone connections
- Drone client implementation with JSON message format
- AI controller logic for assigning drones to survivors

## Phase 3: Advanced Features & Testing
- Load testing with 50+ drones
- Fault tolerance for disconnected drones
- Optional extensions: web-based dashboard, QoS prioritization
