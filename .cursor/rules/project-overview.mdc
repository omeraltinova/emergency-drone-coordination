# Project Overview - Emergency Drone Coordination System

This is a client-server system for emergency drone coordination where drones (clients) communicate with a central server to coordinate emergency aid for survivors.

## Key Components:
- **Server**: Coordinates drones and manages survivors
- **Drones**: Client components that connect to server and perform rescue missions
- **Communication Protocol**: JSON-based protocol for client-server interactions
