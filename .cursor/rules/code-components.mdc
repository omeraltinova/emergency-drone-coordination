# Code Components

## Client (Drone)
Key functions:
- `connect_to_server()`: Establishes TCP connection
- `send_status_update()`: Periodically reports drone state
- `navigate_to_target()`: Simulates movement toward survivor coordinates
- See [drone.c](mdc:drone.c) for implementation

## Server
Key functions:
- `handle_drone()`: Thread to manage each drone connection
- `assign_missions()`: AI logic to match drones and survivors
- `log_performance()`: Track average survivor wait time and drone utilization
- See [server.c](mdc:server.c) for implementation

## List Implementation
- Thread-safe list operations required for concurrent access
- Implement mutex synchronization for all operations
- See [list.c](mdc:list.c) for implementation

## Visualization
- SDL-based visualization of drones, survivors, and missions
- See [view.c](mdc:view.c) for implementation
